# Vibrio cholerae OriC Length Finder

This project calculates the **length of the origin of replication (OriC)** in *Vibrio cholerae*.  
It also counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C).

## Files
- `ori_length.py` → Python script that calculates Ori length and nucleotide counts.  
- `README.md` → Project description.

## Example Run
```bash
$ python ori_length.py
Length of Vibrio cholerae Ori sequence: 245
Nucleotide counts: {'A': 68, 'T': 61, 'G': 59, 'C': 57}
